question-id: visualizing-a-decision-tree
question-body:
  description: The given picture is a complete visualization of a binary classification tree. Answer the following questions. 1. How many features does the classification tree have? 2. What is the most likely depth of the tree, 2, 4 or 8, Why? 3. Which line indicates the first split of the root node of the tree, why? 4. If you are going to prune a leaf, which region will it be (answer is not unique)?

    - {type: image, link: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Asi7O.png, description: visualization of a decision tree.}
  hints:
    - How is a feature represented?
    - What's the relationship between the depth of the tree and the number of leaves?
    - What is the characteristic of the root node?
    - What is the character of leaf node?
  answer: 1. 2 features. 2. The tree has a depth of 4. 3. The only horizontal line that spans from left edge to right edge. 4. One of the smallest rectangles.
