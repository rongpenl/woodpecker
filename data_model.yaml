  hints:
    - What is the definition of $R^2$?
    - What other factors are involved in adjusted $R^2$
  answer: The adjusted $R^2$ is defined as $1-(1-R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$ where $n$ is the total number of data points and $p$ is the total number of explanatory variables in the model, excluding constants.
